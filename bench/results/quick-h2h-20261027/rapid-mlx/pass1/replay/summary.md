| rapid-mlx | 50.250 | 50.250 | 0 |

## Cached-token fraction per turn (cached / prompt tok, median over reps)

| turn | rapid-mlx |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | unknown |
| 2 | 43.5% |
| 3 | 63.8% |
| 4 | 73.5% |
| 5 | 78.9% |
| 6 | 82.8% |

## Decode tok/s per turn (median over reps)

| turn | rapid-mlx |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 49.4 |
| 2 | 45.6 |
| 3 | n/a |
| 4 | n/a |
| 5 | n/a |
| 6 | n/a |
| 7 | n/a |
| 8 | n/a |

## Notes

- TTFT = first content chunk minus send; it includes the first decode step, so it is a prefill proxy.
- `unknown` cached fraction: server reported no cached_tokens and no `--server-log` hit was found.
- request errors: 0; rows excluded from decode (short / no_usage): 6.
