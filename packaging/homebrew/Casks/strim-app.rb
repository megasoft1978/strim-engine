  # Deliberately no zap stanza: ~/.strim holds the user's API tokens, models, jobs and logs and is never removed.

  caveats <<~EOS
    The app bundles the strim CLI; model weights are not included (about 16 GB).
    Strim keeps its state under ~/.strim (tokens, models, packs, jobs, logs, cache).
    `brew uninstall --cask strim-app` does not remove it.
